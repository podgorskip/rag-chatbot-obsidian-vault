# RAG Chatbot for Obsidian

Vault is a local, privacy-first AI chatbot that reads your Obsidian vault, indexes it into a searchable knowledge base, and lets you have multi-turn conversations with your own notes - all running on your machine with no data leaving it.

Your Obsidian notes (.md files)
        │
        ▼
[ obsidian_connector.py ]
  • Reads all markdown files recursively
  • Strips wikilinks, tags, frontmatter, code blocks
  • Splits each note by heading into chunks
  • Embeds every chunk with sentence-transformers
  • Saves to knowledge_base.pkl
        │
        ▼
[ RAG (rag.py) ]
  • Embeds the user's query
  • Finds the most similar chunks via cosine similarity
  • If nothing found → rephrases query and retries
  • Builds a context string within token limits
        │
        ▼
[ Chatbot (chatbot.py) & Redis ]
  • Maintains full conversation history per session in Redis
  • Injects fresh retrieved context into every turn
  • Sends system prompt + history + context to the LLM
        │
        ▼
[ LLMClient (llm_client.py) ]
  • Talks to Ollama (local) or OpenAI (cloud)
  • Normalises both into a single response interface
        │
        ▼
[ FastAPI (app.py & api/) ]
  • Exposes modular API routes (/chat, /sessions, /settings, etc.)
  • Serves the web UI at /
        │
        ▼
[ Browser UI (index.html) ]
  • Dark, startup-style chat interface
  • Thinking animation while model responds
  • Rich Markdown rendering for responses
  • Settings panel to change vault path at runtime

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com) installed and running locally
- [Redis](https://redis.io/) installed and running locally
- An Obsidian vault with markdown notes (or any folder of `.md` files)
- ~2 GB disk space for the default model

---

## Installation

### 1. Clone and create environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/podgorskip/rag-chatbot-obsidian-vault
cd rag-chat

conda create -n rag-chat python=3.12
conda activate rag-chat
```

### 2. Install Python dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

`requirements.txt`:
```
sentence-transformers==3.0.1
scikit-learn==1.5.1
numpy==2.0.1
pandas==2.2.2
torch==2.4.0
requests==2.32.3
openai==1.40.6
fastapi==0.115.6
uvicorn==0.30.6
pydantic==2.8.2
python-dotenv~=1.2.2
redis
```

### 3. Install and start Ollama

```bash
# Install Ollama (macOS)
brew install ollama

# Pull a model (choose one)
ollama pull llama3.2        # recommended — ~2 GB, good quality
ollama pull llama3.2:1b     # lighter — ~1 GB, faster

# Start the Ollama server (runs in background)
ollama serve
```

Verify it's running:
```bash
curl http://localhost:11434
# → Ollama is running
```

### 4. Install and start Redis

Redis is used to persist and manage multi-session conversation histories.

```bash
# Install Redis (macOS)
brew install redis

# Start the Redis server (runs in background)
brew services start redis
```

### 5. Configure your vault

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
VAULT_PATH=/Users/yourname/Documents/MyVault
EXCLUDE_FOLDERS=templates,archive,.trash
KNOWLEDGE_BASE=generated_sources/knowledge_base.pkl
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
```

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `VAULT_PATH` | Absolute path to your Obsidian vault root |
| `EXCLUDE_FOLDERS` | Comma-separated folder names to skip |
| `KNOWLEDGE_BASE` | Where to save the embedded index |
| `REDIS_URL` | Connection URL for your Redis instance |

### 6. Build the knowledge base

The server builds it automatically on first start, but you can also run it manually:

```bash
python connectors/obsidian_connector.py /Users/yourname/Documents/MyVault
```

With options:
```bash
python connectors/obsidian_connector.py /path/to/vault \
    --output generated_sources/knowledge_base.pkl \
    --model all-MiniLM-L6-v2 \
    --exclude-dirs templates archive .trash \
    --exclude-files README.md
```

This step can take 30 seconds to a few minutes depending on vault size. It only needs to run again when you add new notes.

---

## Running the app

```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload --port 8000
```

Then open your browser at:
```
http://localhost:8000
```

---

## Using the chat interface

**Asking questions** - type your question and press `Enter`. The model retrieves the most relevant passages from your notes and uses them to answer, complete with full Markdown formatting (lists, headers, code blocks). It remembers the conversation so follow-up questions like *"tell me more"* or *"what did you mean by that?"* work correctly.

**Token counter** - if you're using OpenAI, each response shows the cumulative token count. Ollama does not report real token counts so this is hidden.

**Sessions** - The app now supports multiple persistent chat sessions, powered by Redis.

**Reset** - clears the current conversation history on both the frontend and the server. The knowledge base is not affected. Use this to start a fresh topic.

**Settings panel** - click ⚙ Settings in the header to:
- Change the vault path
- Update excluded folders
- Point to a different knowledge base file
- Trigger a full re-index of the vault

Changes take effect immediately without restarting the server.

## Configuration reference

All model behaviour is controlled in `rags/rag_config.py`:

```python
class Config:
    def __init__(self):
        self.MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS = 2000
        self.MIN_SIMILARITY = 0.5
        self.DELTA_CUTOFF = 0.08
        self.TOP_K = 0.5
        
        self.REPHRASE_PROMPT = """You are a helpful assistant. Rephrase the following user query to be more descriptive and
        search-engine friendly. Output ONLY the rephrased query."""
        
        self.ANSWER_PROMPT = """You are a fast, sophisticated, direct assistant.
        Base only on the context attached. Use your knowledge only to understand query, not to generate answer.
        ..."""
```

| Parameter | Effect |
|---|---|
| `TOP_K` | Higher = more chunks retrieved, slower but more context |
| `MIN_SIMILARITY` | Lower = looser matching, may retrieve less relevant chunks |
| `DELTA_CUTOFF` | Controls how aggressively low-relevance chunks are cut off |
| `MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS` | Hard cap on how much context is sent to the LLM |

---

## Using OpenAI instead of Ollama

Update `api/utils.py`:

```python
client = LLMClient(
    provider="openai",
    api_key="sk-...",
    model="gpt-4o-mini"
)
rag = RAG(client=client, embedding_model=embed_model, df=df, llm_model="gpt-4o-mini")
```

Or store the key in `.env`:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

And load it in `api/utils.py`:

```python
client = LLMClient(
    provider="openai",
    api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
)
```

When using OpenAI, cumulative token counts are displayed in the UI after each response.

---

## Rebuilding the index

You need to rebuild when you add, edit, or delete notes in your vault:

**Via the UI** — open Settings → click **Rebuild Index**

**Via the API:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/settings/rebuild
```

**Via CLI:**
```bash
python connectors/obsidian_connector.py /path/to/vault --output generated_sources/knowledge_base.pkl
```

The server reloads the new index automatically without a restart.

## Troubleshooting

**`404 Not Found` from Ollama**

The model name doesn't match what's installed. Run `ollama list` and use the exact name shown.

**Empty Ollama list / no models**
```bash
ollama pull llama3.2
```

**Answers are irrelevant or hallucinated**

Lower `MIN_SIMILARITY` in `rags/rag_config.py` to retrieve more chunks, or rebuild the index after updating your notes.

**Slow responses**

Switch to a smaller model (`llama3.2:1b`). First response after starting Ollama is always slower — subsequent ones are faster as the model stays loaded in memory.

---

## Privacy

Everything runs locally. Your notes, queries, and conversation history never leave your machine when using Ollama. The only network requests are to Google Fonts for the UI typography, to a CDN for Markdown rendering scripts, and to `huggingface.co` once to download the embedding model on first run.
